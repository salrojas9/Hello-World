# Hello-World
This is the github tutorial "Hello World".  Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
We have created a branch and are now learning about committs.  Committs are like a history notepad where all the editing is documented.  Here we can see what is being edited and why.  Additionally, committ messages capture the history of your changes.
